# Keylogger-With-Encrypted-Data-Exfiltration-
A Proof-of-Concept Keylogger that encrypts logs and simulates exfiltration

## Project Overview:

This is a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) encrypted keylogger built using Python. It captures user keystrokes, encrypts them using AES (Fernet), and simulates the secure exfiltration of logs to a local Flask-based server.

The project is designed strictly for ethical testing and educational purposes only.

## Requirements:

- [pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) for capturing keystrokes
- [cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) for AES encryption (Fernet)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) to simulate a remote server
- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) to simulate a remote server

## Folder Structure:

project/
- .gitignore
- README.md
- keylogger/
  - keylogger.py # Captures keystrokes to log.txt
  - encryptor.py # Encrypts logs into log.enc
  - upload_client.py # Sends encrypted file to server
  - log.txt # Generated Plain keystroke log
  - log.enc # Generated Encrypted log
  - key.key # Generated Fernet encryption key
- server/
  - server.py # Flask server to receive logs
- uploads/ # (Generated) Folder for received logs

---

## How It Works:

1. **Keylogger** (`keylogger.py`) captures keyboard input and writes it to `log.txt`.
2. **Encryptor** (`encryptor.py`) uses a randomly generated Fernet AES key to encrypt `log.txt` into `log.enc`.
3. **Flask Server** (`server.py`) listens on `http://localhost:5000/upload` to receive encrypted files.
4. **Uploader** (`upload_client.py`) simulates sending the `log.enc` to the server via an HTTP POST request.
5. Logs are saved securely in the `uploads/` folder on the server side.

## How To Run This Project On Windows/Linux:

### 1. Install Python Dependancies

- Make sure Python 3 is installed. Then run:
  pip install pynput cryptography flask requests

### 2. Run the Keylogger

- Captures keystrokes and saves them in log.txt
- Run with this command:
  python keylogger/keylogger.py
- Press a few keys, then stop with "Ctrl + C"

### 3. Encrypt the Logs

- Encrypt the logs with Fernet AES
- Run with this command:
  python keylogger/encryptor.py
- This will generate:
  - log.enc (encrypted data)
  - key.key (your secret key)

### 4. Start the Flask Server

- Simulate a remote endpoint for exfiltration
- Run using this command:
  python server/server.py
- it runs on https://localhost:5000/upload

### 5. Send Encrypted Log to Server

- Simulate exfiltration to the server
- Run with this command
  python keylogger/upload_client.py
- Encrypted file will be stored in the uploads/ folder on the server.

### 6. Add these to .gitignore

__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.enc
*.log
log.txt
key.key
uploads/
